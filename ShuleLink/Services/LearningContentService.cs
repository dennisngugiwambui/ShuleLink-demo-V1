## Respiratory System
The respiratory system helps us breathe and get oxygen.

### Parts:

- **Trachea (Windpipe)** - Tube that carries air to lungs
- **Lungs** - Two organs that take in oxygen
- **Diaphragm** - Muscle that helps us breathe

### How it works:

- **Stomach** - Mixes food with acid to break it down
- **Small Intestine** - Absorbs nutrients from food
- **Large Intestine** - Removes waste from body

### Process:
1. Chew food in mouth
2. Swallow - food goes to stomach
3. Stomach breaks down food
4. Nutrients absorbed in intestines
5. Waste removed from body

## Circulatory System
Carries blood throughout the body.

### Parts:
- **Heart** - Pumps blood around body
- **Blood vessels** - Tubes that carry blood

## Nervous System
Controls all body functions and helps us think.

### Central Nervous System:
- **Brain** - Control center, processes information
  - *Cerebrum* - Thinking, memory, movement
  - *Cerebellum* - Balance and coordination  
  - *Brain stem* - Controls breathing, heart rate
- **Spinal Cord** - Carries messages between brain and body

### Peripheral Nervous System:
- **Nerves** - Carry electrical signals
- **Sensory nerves** - Bring information to brain
- **Motor nerves** - Carry commands to muscles

### How it works:
1. Senses detect information (sight, sound, touch)
2. Nerves send signals to brain
3. Brain processes information
4. Brain sends commands back through nerves
5. Body responds (move, speak, etc.)

## Excretory System
Removes waste products from the body.

### Parts:
- **Kidneys** - Filter blood, remove waste
- **Bladder** - Stores urine
- **Ureters** - Tubes from kidneys to bladder
- **Urethra** - Tube from bladder to outside
- **Skin** - Removes waste through sweat
- **Lungs** - Remove carbon dioxide

### Functions:
- Filter blood to remove toxins
- Maintain water balance in body
- Remove excess salts and minerals
- Regulate blood pressure

## Reproductive System
Allows humans to create new life.

### Male System:
- Produces sperm cells

- **Reproductive glands** - Control puberty and reproduction

### Hormones:
- Chemical messengers in blood
